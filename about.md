The TinTin++ Unofficial's User Group is an attempt to bring the TinTin++ community together and improve the way that we share code and documentation. This user's group is brand new and is currently being maintained by @nfarrar.


Documentation
-------------
The [Unofficial TinTin++ Documentation](https://tintinplusplus-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/) is an attempt to build robust, current documentation on the TinTin++ scripting language. The official documentation is much out of date, with new features being commonly used but completely undocumented (tables are a good example of this).


Script Repository
-----------------
The script repository is currently empty. I'm hoping to work with some others to come up with some good ideas of how this can be best created and maintained.


Source Code Mirror
------------------
@avidal maintains a mirror on github of the tintin++ source that has been added to the tintinplusplus organization. It is available [here](http://github.com/tintinplusplus/tintin).


IRC Channel
-----------
The unofficial TinTin++ IRC channel is <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/tintin">#tintin on freenode</a>.
